# multi-money

[![Clojure CI](https://github.com/dgknght/multi-money/actions/workflows/clojure.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dgknght/multi-money/actions/workflows/clojure.yml)

Double-entry accounting system written in Clojure and designed to
use multiple back-end storage strategies.

## Overview

This project is a combination of my desire to have a cloud-based,
easy-to-use accounting tool, and a vehicle with which I test programming
tools and strategies.

### Models
```mermaid
erDiagram
  user ||--|{ identity : "is identified by"
  user {
    string username
    string given-name
    string surname
    string email
  }
  identity {
    string oauth-id
    string oauth-provider
  }
```
## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build run:

	lein clean
	lein fig:min
